## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devsrealm/filament-erpnext.git
    cd filament-erpnext
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install JavaScript dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build # Or npm run dev for development
    ```

4.  **Create your environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, update `.env` with your database credentials, application URL, and other environment-specific settings.

5.  **Generate application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed # Optional: --seed to run seeders if available
    ```

7.  **Link storage directory (if needed for file uploads):**
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

8.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` (or the configured port).
